*ROUGH DRAFT*
-Reinholt
A primarily human country to the west of free cities. Temperate and cool, the 
weather is pleasant to its inhabitents. It has miles of well cultured farmland, 
and food is rarely an issue. The winters are cold and frosty, but not harsh. To
the east are wetlands that eventually turn into a near barren bog and to the 
south would be the open sea.

-Sycurose
The elvish nation to the southwest of the free cities. Its quite often humid 
with rather large seasonal storms that cause massive damage along the coasts. 
Because of this, the coastal cities are nomadic in nature, as they move inland 
during the summer seasons. To the north is a harbor rarely ravaged by storms, so
there are a few persistant cities within the nation. From spring to fall, the 
weather is quite warm, blistering even. However as winter arrives, the 
tempuratures take sheer dive inland. Never enough to freeze, the air becomes 
numbing, driving the people inland.

-Etterd
To the north east of the free cities exists a world of high spires and frozen 
peaks. Spring and summer are short, and the winters harsh and long. To survive,
the orcs of this region have developed a tradition of winter hunts to meet their
daily food quotas. Crops in this region are grown in green houses from spring to
fall. To the north east is a mountain pass to the barrens.

-Free Cities
The central point where the three landmasses meet. Fair and temperate, the land
initally seems ideal for settling. However, the wetlands turn to acidic bogs 
which all eventually lead to the barrens. Usually the free cities have a few
settlements made up of outlaws from the mix of the three regions. 

-Barrens
At the very center of the free cities is a region which the people call the 
barrens. The ground is ash, the air toxic, and the water blood red with iron and
aresnic. Further in the ash wastes are a ring of spires, resembling the spine of
the world, if it were made of glass and dross. The snow that appears here melts 
in the spring, running down these spires, picking up rust and other toxins. The
high winds chip and fragment the glass, causing the winds here to lacerate 
anyone unprepared. If people acutally manage to scale the glass spires, they 
would be greeted with a site of absolute desolation. In the array of glass 
spires is a blood red sea, slowly draining away in several locations.
