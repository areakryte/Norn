*ROUGH DRAFT*
-Reinholt (Humans)
    From the bitter north to the warm and gracious southern farmlands, Reinholt is a
land of moderates. Food is plentiful due to the vast plains and farmlands in the
south. Every winter there are storms that cause the banks of the rivers to 
overflow, causing the plains to flood with a relatively thin layer of water, but
more importantly silt. As a result, the people in this region build their houses
and grain silos on solid foundations that resist the rising waters every winter.
North of these farmlands is a range of temperate forests, filled with hearty 
maples, oaks, and wild walnut trees. As a result, the land here is perfect for 
the many orchards that dot this area. With the addition of fruit in this region
comes the many apiaries and breweries that also found in this country. Next is 
the region of highlands that serve as additional farmlands. Since there is no 
seasonal flooding in this area, the highlands serve as grazing grounds for the 
cattle in the area. Lastly there are the pine forests to the mountains in the 
north. Typically this region is ignored as it is on the border of Etterd, their
Orcish neighbors. The winters here are harsher, and the soil rocky. The only 
purpose this region servers is as a source of metals for the other cities to the
south.
    The people of region may have different styles of dress and different 
traditions, but generally they have the same religious beliefs. Their faith is
almost akin to that of a polytheistic church, but structured. They believe in 
the three sisters of creation, the ones who defended the people from a false god
of madness. First there is Lithie who represents the concept of truth and 
foresight. Crows and ravens are her symbol and the people who follow her 
typically have clothing with black feathers either emblazoned on or actual black
feathers. Second there is Nekene who represents the willingness to serve as well
as the aspect of magic. Her symbol is that of a black flame and the legends 
state that as her signature spell, the fires of the void, would actually take in
all light, leaving their enemies blind and help less. Thirdly there is Khylessia
who represents protection and strength. The wolf is her symbol and this is 
usually demonstrated by fangs or claw on clothing. Again, the symbols within 
this nation typically are black, but then are highlighted in silver, icy 
blues and whites.
    Because of the wide range of temperatures in the region, there is a wide
variety of clothing in the nation. The people in the north dress with more furs
as typically, the winters make it a necessity. The southerners have more cloth
and boots that can resist the heavy rains that come about the winters. Since the
summers are generally mild, there are a good array of short sleeves, although
there have records of relatively cold summers as well, which necessitate the 
constant use of longer sleeves and pants within the region.

-Sycurose
The elvish nation to the southwest of the free cities. Its quite often humid 
with rather large seasonal storms that cause massive damage along the coasts. 
Because of this, the coastal cities are nomadic in nature, as they move inland 
during the summer seasons. To the north is a harbor rarely ravaged by storms, so
there are a few persistant cities within the nation. From spring to fall, the 
weather is quite warm, blistering even. However as winter arrives, the 
tempuratures take sheer dive inland. Never enough to freeze, the air becomes 
numbing, driving the people inland.

-Etterd
To the north east of the free cities exists a world of high spires and frozen 
peaks. Spring and summer are short, and the winters harsh and long. To survive,
the orcs of this region have developed a tradition of winter hunts to meet their
daily food quotas. Crops in this region are grown in green houses from spring to
fall. To the north east is a mountain pass to the barrens.

-Free Cities
The central point where the three landmasses meet. Fair and temperate, the land
initally seems ideal for settling. However, the wetlands turn to acidic bogs 
which all eventually lead to the barrens. Usually the free cities have a few
settlements made up of outlaws from the mix of the three regions. 

-Barrens
At the very center of the free cities is a region which the people call the 
barrens. The ground is ash, the air toxic, and the water blood red with iron and
aresnic. Further in the ash wastes are a ring of spires, resembling the spine of
the world, if it were made of glass and dross. The snow that appears here melts 
in the spring, running down these spires, picking up rust and other toxins. The
high winds chip and fragment the glass, causing the winds here to lacerate 
anyone unprepared. If people acutally manage to scale the glass spires, they 
would be greeted with a site of absolute desolation. In the array of glass 
spires is a blood red sea, slowly draining away in several locations.
