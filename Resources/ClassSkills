#Skill set possiblities
#All WIP
#All status have a chance to trigger
#All values have to be tweeked
#DEFINATELY NEEDS A LOT OF WORK
=========================
Passive Masteries
=========================
#Basically Weapon Masteries for different classes
#This is when it appears as weapons that they can use
#This means that a class can get a mastery twice such as Dervish -> Spellblade
#It will mean that they have a better sword mastery than lets say
#Warrior -> Druid as there is only one level of sword mastery there.
#The more use a weapon gets, the more the passive skill levels. 
#The system is C->B->A and if you get the second skill mastery A->S->SS
